We assume the mortality hazard rate at age $t$ is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda_t = \alpha \exp(\beta t)
\end{eqnarray}

The survival rate to age $t$ is therefore given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
	S_t = \exp(-\frac{\alpha}{\beta}(\exp(\beta t)-1))
\end{eqnarray}

The life table survival rates, $S^0_t$ are well approximated by this process with parameters $(\alpha_0,\beta_0)$. We are interested in estimating $S^i_t, the individual survival rates of respondents $i$. 

The question asked concerns survival to age $a$ at age $t. We have: 

\begin{eqnarray}
S^i_{t,a} = S^i_{a}/S^i_{t} = \exp(-\frac{\alpha}{\beta}(\exp{\beta t} - \exp(\beta a)))
\end{eqnarray}

Given we have one such probability by respondent, we assume $\beta$ is the same across individuals and equal to life table estimates, $\beta_i = \beta_0$. Then we have

\begin{eqnarray}
	\log S^i_{t,a} = -\frac{\alpha_i}{\beta_0}(\exp(\beta_0 t) - \exp(\beta_0 a))
\end{eqnarray}

and therefore 

\begin{eqnarray}
	r_i = \frac{\log S^i_{t,a}}{\log S^0_{t,a}} = \frac{\alpha_i}{\alpha_0}.
\end{eqnarray}

We can therefore estimates $\alpha_i$ using 

\begin{eqnarray}
	\alpha_i = r_i * \alpha_0. 
\begin{eqnarray}

Few respondents report estimates of zero and 100 for $S^i_{t,a}$. We loose 18 respondents due to missing of zero reported probability of survival.
