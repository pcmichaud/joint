@article{gustman1986,
	Abstract = {The life cycle model analyzed here constrains most work on the main
	job to be full-time. Partial retirement entails a wage reduction
	and frequently a job change. Maximum likelihood estimates of utility
	function parameters are designed to incorporate information on the
	age of leaving full-time work and the age of full retirement. The
	model closely tracks retirement behavior, including peaks in retirement
	activity at 62 and 65. The paper explores the relation of these peaks
	to nonlinearities in the budget constraint created by various retirement
	programs. Policy analyses based on this and on earlier models with
	simpler structures are compared.},
